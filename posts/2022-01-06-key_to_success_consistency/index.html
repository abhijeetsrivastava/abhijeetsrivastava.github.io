        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I am going to write a few blog posts on things I consider are most important for
success. This is part 1 of this series.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to define meaning of success, what it means. A poor guy might
want money, ill person would want health, a student might want good marks and job. Everyone has their own definition. So it is important to define
one&rsquo;s own <a href="/posts/2022-01-06-what_is_success/">definition of success</a>.</p>
<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Key to success: Consistency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many key components of success. We are going to explore one of it and
what it means.</p>
<p>There are two ways how people approach any project/goal.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->People who want something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might just start working sporadically and hope to
get it. That sporadic motivation in them leads to spend time to figure out
what they need to do in order for them to get what they want. If they have the
answer already they spend time on working towards it. A student might one day
want to master calculus and start solving questions from the material they
already have.</p>
<p>Then there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->people who need something<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They work towards their goal consistently
until they see a glimpse of how it is taking them close to their goal or
fail in their attempt and get ready to try again with a new plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try and fail until you succeed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One cannot be the person in the first scenario and working only casually towards
a goal. One needs to be consistent. A spark lasts split second unless it gets
stuck to a fuel(plan) and then needs consistent effort to keep the fire going.</p>
<p>This is the first step.</p>
<h2 id="planning-phase">Planning phase</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say your long term goal is to clear an exam. You need to
<a href="/posts/2022-01-06-planning_phase/">have a plan</a>
and be consistent with it.</p>
<p>The plan should be easy and achievable with other things going in your life.
Studying 4-5 hours a day will give you success, albeit you are consistently
putting the effort.</p>
<p>This is the only solution to achieve success. There are others that piggyback on
this idea. We can achieve success, if we are consistent.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is simply one the most important factor in life. I use to think that
planning is the most important part for success, while true there is no ultimate
plan. One needs to experiment with plans and resources but be consistent in your
efforts for success.</p>
