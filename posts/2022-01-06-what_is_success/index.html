        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p><strong>Success</strong> is a relative topic. One needs to grasp this concept to be happy.
Success is about being the best in a class/field, but success is also to be able
to spend time with family after a rough day and still smile and be with them.
Success is also being able to play with your mom/dad after coming back from
school. Success is health during these tough times, its being able to get
medical care and vaccine and its also having others around you be aware of the
importance of being vaccinated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success is what makes you happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p><strong>Define your own success.</strong> It is simple, relative and changes with time.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it flexible</strong>. Its important to focus on different areas of life. Do not
have a rigid meaning of success. Do not just want to succeed in a class when you
would be graduating in a couple of months, and you get just one chance to appear
in the exams. The definition of success should be more around the lines that you
are doing the best based on the constraints that life has presented you.</p>
<p><strong>Keep them changing</strong>. In order to enjoy life one should focus on different
things, enjoy experiences which they may not have wanted to initially.</p>
<p><strong>Review your efforts</strong>. This is super important. I will talk about it more in the
topic mindfulness. Unless you are reviewing your efforts you might derail.</p>
<p><strong>Consistently</strong> pursue your goals. Keep moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Success is relative, and takes effort. One needs vigilance in order to keep them
on the right path.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>I am going to start a series and write on this topic from time to time. I will
update the index here of the topics which I am going to cover as part of it.</p>
