        <h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>Running has been a part of my life since my bachelor&rsquo;s and I have found one
way or other to keep at it. During the 2020 lockdown it was difficult to run
outside and I didn&rsquo;t like running with my mask on. I thought of buying a
treadmill to keep myself active.</p>
<p>So far I have made a schedule and have stuck with it for sometime now. I
thought it would be a good thing to share with everyone who might find it
informational / motivational.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-schedule">My current schedule</h2>

<h4 id="long-run">Long run</h4>
<p>This comprises of running for longer interval with medium pace that
varies over time. I start with warm-up, start run and then cooldown.</p>
<h4 id="easy-run-recovery">Easy Run/recovery</h4>
<p>During this day, I just run for short amount of time for recovery.
I accompany this with brisk walking.</p>
<h4 id="slow-run-with-tempo">Slow run with tempo</h4>
<p>Here I run for sometime after warm-up and keep a slow pace for the entire time.</p>
<h4 id="tempo-run">Tempo run</h4>
<p>This run is of exact same duration as above but I pick a faster pace and keep
it varying.</p>
<h4 id="fast-paced-interval-run">Fast paced interval run</h4>
<p>I would define this as a set: 2 minutes brisk walk +
run at a fast pace for 8 minutes.</p>
<p>I repeat this set 3-4 times.</p>
<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>
<ol>
<li>Massaging calves helps. I do it often.</li>
<li>Using a roller is a godsend gift. I would like to do it once a week.</li>
</ol>
<p>One other thing that every runner does is <strong>stretching</strong>. Static stretching is
really good when one would like to avoid any injury.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-would-like-to-achieve-in-2021">What I would like to achieve in 2021</h2>
<p>My long time goal is to run a half marathon (13.1 miles or 21 km).</p>
<p>For this year though, I would like to run at-least 300 days. As per my plan I
wont run for 52 days, and I want a cushion of 10 days at-least.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-would-recommend-for-beginners">What I would recommend for beginners</h2>
<p>Start with any c25k programs out there. For example, this is a great plan for
beginners <a href="https://www.hyderabadrunners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Couch-to-5k-Training-Plan.pdf">c25k hyderabad</a></p>
<p>Here are the steps I would recommend</p>
<ol>
<li>Brisk walking is another great alternative to running and one should always
start with that.</li>
<li>Either get your weight under control or get comfortable doing
brisk walks.</li>
<li>Start with a walk/run interval which should gradually translate to running.</li>
<li>Get comfortable running for 5 minutes continuously, then 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Register for a 5K run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Registering for a 5K run, possibly with a buddy, is one of the best things. Do
not wait for yourself to be ready. As long as you can run for 25-30 minutes,
go ahead and register. Most of the 5K are chill and do not expect you to run
continuously where you can do a run/walk interval. I would say, this step is a
must.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Get started and get moving! Do not wait for a Monday or a perfect weather to
start running, just get started on any day you feel like. The days you do not
feel like, run anyways. This is a skill which develops overtime and there is
no shortcut.</p>
<p>Happy Running!</p>
