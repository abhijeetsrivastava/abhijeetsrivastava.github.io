      <description>Intro I am going to write a few blog posts on things I consider are most important for success. This is part 1 of this series.
Everyone needs to define meaning of success, what it means. A poor guy might want money, ill person would want health, an old would desire to have their youth once more. Everyone has their own definition. So it is important to define one&amp;rsquo;s own definition of success.</description>

      <description>Intro Success is a relative topic. One needs to grasp this concept to be happy. Success is about being the best in a class/field, but success is also to be able to spend time with family after a rough day and still smile and be with them. Success is also being able to play with your mom/dad after coming back from school. Success is health during these tough times, its being able to get medical care and vaccine and its also having others around you be aware of the importance of being vaccinated.</description>
