      <description>Running Running has been a part of my life since my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and I have found one way or other to keep at it. During the 2020 lockdown it was difficult to run outside and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like running with my mask on. I thought of buying a treadmill to keep myself active.
So far I have made a schedule and have stuck with it for sometime now. I thought it would be a good thing to share with everyone who might find it informational / motivational.</description>

      <description>A programmer needs a good IDE A good IDE is a programmers best friend. Writing clean code requires one to spend time in their code base and to have a look and feel of various parts of code. Search files, syntax highlighting, completions, renaming, formatting with fmt flavored styles etc are few of the many things that programmers rely on to write clean code.
Its of paramount importance that one knows their own IDE same as they would know about the car they drive.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Scala: Though the concepts mentioned in this post are related to Scala, they are universal.
 Thought: A program should not use null.
Null, if not handled, can be troublesome just like an unhandled exception. One should actively try and avoid its usage.
Here are a couple of ways to avoid them.
How to avoid them? Without initial default value  What to do when a var field in a class or method doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an initial default value?</description>

      <description>object Hello { println(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;) } Having written a lot of hello world programs I want to share my experience with other developers. I could use feedback from peers.
I am going to document code snippets, concepts, tech news, interview tips, lifestyle, and a few random stuff.
I will provide a platform to request topics, and or share ideas with me in future. But let&amp;rsquo;s start with baby steps.
So, Hey!</description>
