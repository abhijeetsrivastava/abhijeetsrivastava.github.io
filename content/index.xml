      <description>I am currently working as a Lead Software Developer at BXBDigital, a Brambles company. I have keen interest in core computer science concepts like Compiler Design, Data Structures, Algorithms, Data Mining, Distributed Computing and Machine Learning.
I have completed my masters in Computer Sciences from University of Delaware. During the course of my masters I was a part-time mobile application developer and later a research assistant under Dr Pollock Lori on a cloud based NSF(National Science Foundation) funded project.</description>
