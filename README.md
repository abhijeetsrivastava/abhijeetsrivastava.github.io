# Abhijeet Srivastava

I'm a software developer who has 9 years of experience.

I have keen interest in core computer science concepts like Compiler Design, Data Structures, Algorithms, Data Mining, Distributed Computing and Machine Learning.

I have completed my masters in Computer Sciences from University of Delaware. During the course of my masters I was a part-time mobile application developer and later a research assistant under Dr Pollock Lori on a cloud based NSF funded project.
